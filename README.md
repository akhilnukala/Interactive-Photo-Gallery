# Interactive-Photo-Gallery

Built an interactive searchable online photo gallery using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, jQuery Plugins such as lightbox and hideseek.

At the top of the page you'll have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. 

When the user clicks on a thumbnail the photo will display in a lightbox. There is a back and previous buttons to cycle through photos.
